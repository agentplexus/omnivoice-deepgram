## Quick Start

```go
import (
    deepgramstt "github.com/agentplexus/omnivoice-deepgram/omnivoice/stt"
    "github.com/agentplexus/omnivoice/stt"
)

// Create STT provider
provider, err := deepgramstt.New(deepgramstt.WithAPIKey("your-api-key"))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Transcribe a local file
result, err := provider.TranscribeFile(ctx, "audio.mp3", stt.TranscriptionConfig{
    Language: "en",
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(result.Text)

// Transcribe from URL
result, err = provider.TranscribeURL(ctx, "https://example.com/audio.mp3", stt.TranscriptionConfig{
    Language: "en",
})
```
